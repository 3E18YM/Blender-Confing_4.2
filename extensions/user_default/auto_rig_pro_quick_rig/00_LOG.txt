[1.26.46]

New/improved:
New "Parent to Main Bones" setting for orphan bones, to parent them to main bones instead of other orphan bones when possible. Helps to resolve cases of complex skeletons, where orphan bones lose their parents
"Parent to Main Bones" is now disabled by default
Added "Auto IK Roll" setting for arms and legs, disabled by default
Each fingers phalange can now be manually set, useful in case phalanges are not direct child of each other
Improved Arm and Fingers Up Axis autodetection by evaluating the axes in a virtual T-pose
Added "Up Axis" setting for arm bones (was only for hand and fingers before)
Improved the straight arms/legs correction (to comply with IK constraints), the angle is now evaluated in the bone's Z axis space instead of global space
Check for update: Now shows a differential log, comparing the log of the new available version versus the current old version
New UE5 preset
Multiple animations baking support
The c_root_master controller shape now tries to fit the global character scale better
Changed the default presets path from C:/Quick Rig Presets/ to /Quick Rig Presets/ to be OS agnostic
Added Global or Local space retargetting for orphan bones animated locations (was always Local before)
Blender 4.0 support. Backward-compatible with older versions.
Interface: moved the "Enable Weights Override" checkbox near the bone names entries for arms and spine limbs
New "UE5 Manny (2 twists)" preset, works best when exporting back the rig to UE
New "Foot Dir Axis" setting for Leg limbs, to determine the foot axis direction in case no toe bone is set
Added a "Fuzzy Match" optional setting when importing built-in presets. It attempts to match the bone names from the preset that are different from the actual skeleton. Warning, prone to error.
New "Force Pelvis Up" setting for spine limbs. Useful when the pelvis bone is not straight up, typically for humanoid characters. Updated the built-in presets with this setting too.
Replaced the "Layer" setting with "Collection" for Blender 4+ versions
New Genesis 9 preset, renamed other presets more appropriately
New UE MetaHuman preset
The Quick Rig preset directory is now set in the Documents folder by default
Toes are now supported for Leg limbs
New "Mirror" feature to automatically create a mirrored limb (only works if bone names are ending/starting with '_l', '.l', '_left' and similar), or replace existing mirrored limb
New "Up" and "Down" buttons to sort the limbs list manually
New Tail limbs support
Improved the "Mirror" feature, supports a wider syntax for left and right identifier, and sort the mirror limb after the original one in the list
